	This document describes the JGoodies Validation API
    that helps you validate user input
     in Swing apps and report validation errors and warnings.
     It is a tiny set of class that has been designed to work 
     with different architectures and programming flavors.
     
	 <p>
	 Since version 2.0 the Validation library requires Java 5 or later.
	 The accompanying tutorial sources require the 
	 <a href="http://binding.dev.java.net/">JGoodies Binding</a>
	 and <a href="http://forms.dev.java.net/">JGoodies Forms</a>. 
	 Versions for Java 1.4 can be found in the 
	 <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/downloads/archive.html">JGoodies Archive</a>.
     
     
	<h3>Getting Started</h3>
	 
	 The Validation tutorial is an important part of this distribution.
	 It demonstrates different ways to use the Validation library
	 and provides reusable code.
	 
	 The tutorial sources ship in folder <tt>src/tutorial</tt>.
<!--	 a <a href="docs/tutorial/introduction.html">tutorial</a> and 
// -->
	 It is recommended to run the precompiled
	 <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/validationdemo/">Validation Demo</a>
	 before you work with the library.
