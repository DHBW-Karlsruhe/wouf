/**
 * Describes validation messages as used by the JGoodies Validation framework.
 * All validation messages provide a formatted text ({@link #formattedText()})
 * and are categorized into types of different severity (@link #severity()}).
 * Validation messages are collected during the validation process and
 * are held by instances of {@link com.jgoodies.validation.ValidationResult}.<p>
 *
 * This class has been designed to be decoupled from user interface components
 * (views) that present and edit the validated data. The design goal is to be
 * able to use the same validation mechanism on the server side, in the domain
 * layer, in a view-less model layer, and in the presentation layer.
 * And we want to ensure that multiple views can present the same model,
 * and so we typically don't store a view in the validation message.
 * On the other hand we want to detect which validation messages belongs
 * to a given user interface component, for example to let the component
 * paint a warning indication.
 * This association between message and view is established by the message key
 * that can be shared between messages, validators, views, and other parties.
 * It can be requested using the {@link #key()} method. The association is
 * checked using <code>#equals</code>; implementors that use rich objects
 * as keys may consider overriding <code>#equals</code>.<p>
 *
 * For example, a validator validates an address object and reports
 * that the zip code is invalid. You may choose the association key
 * as <code>"address.zipCode"</code>. All views that present the zip code
 * can now check and verify whether a validation result contains messages
 * with this key and may paint a special warning background.
 * If the validated data contains two different address objects, let's say
 * a shipping address and a physical address, the address validator may
 * add a prefix and create keys like <code>physical.address.zipCode</code>
 * and <code>shipping.address.zipCode</code>. A view can now differentiate
 * between the two zip codes.<p>
 *
 * We've choosen to let the <code>ValidationMessage</code> check whether
 * an association key matches or not. This way, an implementation of this
 * interface can choose to provide special checks. The default behavior
 * in class {@link com.jgoodies.validation.message.AbstractValidationMessage}
 * just checks whether a given association key equals a stored key.<p>
 *
 * Implementors may hold additional objects, for example the validation target,
 * a description of the target, or a description of the validated property.
 * Implementors are encouraged to implement <code>#equals</code> and
 * <code>#hashCode</code> to prevent unnecessary change notifications
 * for the <em>result</em> property when a ValidationResultModel
 * gets a new ValidationResult. See for example the implementation of method
 * {@link com.jgoodies.validation.message.PropertyValidationMessage#equals(Object)}.
